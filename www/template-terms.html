            an updated version of the web browsers Google Chrome or Firefox. Relation Desk strives to give the customer
            a truly outstanding user experience, Relation Desk does however not give a guarantee that the service, or
            any specific part of it, will be available at all times. One of the reasons for this is that when Facebook’s
            APIs, Twitter’s APIs or any other needed services, are not functioning properly or are changed, the Relation
            Desk service will not function as desired.

            an event the User is not entitled to any repayment or compensation.
