            data processing agreement with the Sub-Processor where the same data protection obligations as set out in
            this DPA are imposed on the Sub-Processor. If the Sub- Processor fails to fulfil its data protection
            obligations, Relation Desk shall remain fully liable towards the Customer for the performance of the Sub-
            Processor’s data protection obligations. The Customer hereby generally authorises Relation Desk to engage
            any other third parties within and outside the EU/EEA to Process Personal Data as a Sub-Processor.
        </div>
        <div class="rd_dpa_content_p">7.2. Relation Desk is in particular responsible for ensuring the compliance of
            Articles 28.2 and 28.4 of the GDPR when engaging Sub-Processors, and to ensure that Sub-Processors provide
            sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures, in such a manner that
            the Processing meets the requirements of the GDPR.
        </div>
        <div class="rd_dpa_content_p">7.3. Upon the Customer’s request, Relation Desk shall provide such specified
            information regarding Processing by Sub-Processors, which the Customer reasonably may request according to

            the addition or replacement of Sub-Processors. The information shall describe the name of the Sub-Processor
            and the place where the Processing takes place. The Customer is also entitled to, upon written request,
            receive information about which type of Processing the Sub-Processor will conduct on Relation Desk’s behalf.
        </div>
        <div class="rd_dpa_content_p">7.5. The Customer is entitled to make a written objection to the changing of a
            Sub-Processor within 30 days from when Relation Desk has notified the Customer of such change. If the
            Customer makes such objection, and Relation Desk does not accept to replace the Sub-Processor or refrain
            from using a Sub- Processor, the Customer have the right to terminate the part/parts of the Agreement which
            the Processing by the Sub-Processor concerns within 30 calendar days from the day when Relation Desk
            informed the Customer about the choice to not replace the Sub-Processor or refraining from using the Sub-
            Processor. The notice period for such termination shall be 90 days.
        </div>
        <div class="rd_dpa_content_p">7.6. If the Customer terminates the Agreement in accordance with section 7.5
            above, wholly or in part, Relation Desk shall, provided that the Customer’s termination of the Agreement is
            based on a justified reason for the objection, repay any payments that have already been made by the
            Customer to Relation Desk that refers to the period after the termination period and the terminated part of
            the Agreement. If the Customer’s objection is justified Relation Desk is not permitted to use the new
            Sub-Processor for Processing on behalf of the Customer during the Customer’s notice period. If the Customer
            does not have a justified reason for the objection, the Customer’s objection will be regarded as an early
            termination of the Agreement, wholly or in part, without cause (meaning, inter alia, that the Customer shall
            pay to Relation Desk any and all remaining fees and charges as agreed in the Agreement). In that case,
            Relation Desk shall be entitled to compensation from the Customer for all Relation Desk’s costs and
            expenditures that result from not being able to use the Sub-Processor in question. In this clause,
            “justified reason” means circumstances on the Sub-Processor’s side that are likely to significantly affect
            or in fact significantly affect the protection of the Data Subject’s personal integrity. Such a circumstance
            may, for example, be that the Sub- Processor does not comply with the requirements imposed on data
            processors according to the Data Protection Rules.
